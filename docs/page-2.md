5. 2 tablespoon yogurt
6. 1 tablespoon lemon juice
7. 1 teaspoon garlic minced
8. 1 teaspoon ginger minced
9. 2 tablespoon oil

For topping ...
1. 1/2 cup pizza sauce (see in my recipes)
2. 1 cup Cheddar cheese shredded
3. 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese shredded
4. 1/2 cup red onions chopped
5. 1/2 cup tomato chopped
6. 1/2 cup capsicum chopped
7. 1/2 cup coriander chopped
8. 2 chopped jalapenos

For the pizza dough
1. 2 cups flour
2. 1/2 tablespoon yeast
3. 1 tablespoon sugar
4. 1 teaspoon salt
5. 2 tablespoon vegetable/olive oil
6. 3/4 cup slightly warm water

## How To Cook
### STEP 1
* Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes.
* Marinate the chicken with all the ingredients (excluding oil) and let it sit for an hour.
* In a skillet, heat oil and fry the marinated chicken on medium flame for 5 minutes.
* Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for approximately 10 minutes or until the chicken dries out.

### STEP 2
* Mix salt with flour.
* Add all the ingredients to the flour mixture.
* Pour water and knead the mixture to form a smooth dough for about 5 to 7 minutes.
* Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it with a slightly damp kitchen towel, and let it     rest for an hour or until it doubles in size.
* After one hour, pat the dough and roll it into a large circle.

### STEP 3
* Leave the prepared dough to rest for 15 minutes.
* Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F).
* Spread pizza sauce evenly over the baked dough.
* Top it with a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese, diced onions, tomatoes, fresh coriander leaves,jalapenos and capsicum.
* Add the Chicken Tikka as a delicious topping.
* Sprinkle a handful of mozzarella cheese on top.
* Bake the pizza at 180°C for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese starts to brown. Keep an eye on the bottom of the pizza crust to prevent it from darkening too much. If needed, place a piece of aluminum foil under the pizza pan to adjust the heat.
