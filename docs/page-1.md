## How To Cook
### Coconut Pigeon Peas

1. In a large pot, bring to a boil the mixture of peas and just enough water to cover, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the peas begin to become tender and most of the water is absorbed.
2. Once tender, take the mbaazi out and store them in a container and in a cooking pot, add the vegetable oil ,your chopped onions,carrots and peppers at the same time. Let them cook to caramelization for maximum flavor.
3. Once caramelized,add the garlic and ginger ,some coriander stems, chillies and allow to cook till fragrant.
4. Add your chopped tomatoes at this point,and some salt to cook down the tomatoes,until it forms a thick paste.
5. Now is the time to add your spices and bring in the boiled mbaazi and pour it into the pot,mix well till combined.
6. Add in your coconut milk, stir then cover to allow cooking for about 10 to 12 minutes on low heat.
7. Garnish with leftover dhania stems.

### Chapati (Flatbread)

1. Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.

2. Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate jar/ bowl. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.

3.  Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix well.

4.  Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough becomes non-sticky. Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue kneading until the oil mixes well and the dough is soft. Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes.

5.  After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts making ball like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with flour(Cover with a damp tablecloth to avoid drying).

6.  Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start rolling with a rolling pin to a circular shape, brush oil on top and roll it inwards to form a shape-like a rope, then create a coil-like shape and press the ball down with your palm to make it flat. Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining balls of dough.

7.  Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the rolling pin to form a circular shape again.

8.  In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place your cooked chapati in a flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil.

9.  Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough.

This meal is purely vegeterian and serves 3-4 people.
